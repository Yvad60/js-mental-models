# JavaScript mental models: JavaScript String

Strings are JavaScript data types that allow storing and manipulating text, Strings will contain text enclosed in quotes, and JavaScript allows using single quotes, double quotes, and backticks. Strings can also include quotes inside as long the inner quotes are different from surrounding quotes.

String also allows escaping characters by using the \
const greetings = “hello \“stranger\” are you good?” // hello “Stranger” are you good?

By default, strings are primitive data types and they don’t have any method attached to them, the reason you can apply the method to string literals is that under the hood, JavaScript will wrap it with the string object and apply methods to it instead.

**String object**
You can create a string object by using the string constructor.

```js
const name = "John" // string primitive
const nameObj = new String("John") // string object

typeof name // “string"
typeof nameObj // "object"
```
