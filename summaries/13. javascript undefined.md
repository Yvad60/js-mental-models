# JavaScript mental models: JavaScript undefined

Undefined is one of the JavaScript primitive data types that represent a value that does not have a value assigned to it. Undefined does not have any method or property attached to it and trying to access anything from undefined will result in an error. Undefined is not a reserved keyword in JavaScript therefore it can be used as a variable name (not recommended though)

There are several scenarios that create undefined in JS
A declared variable with no value assigned yet
An unprovided function argument will be auto-signed to undefined
A function that does not have a return automatically returns undefined
Accessing any property that does not exist in an object will return undefined.
