# What are mental models

A mental model is a mental presentation of how something works or a presentation of your thinking process about something. For example, when a user lands on a website, they have expectations about how something should work. For example, some people may expect a blue underlined word to be a link and that’s their mental model about links.

In programming mental models are about how you think about some concepts. For example, when someone mentions a variable, you may think of it as a box containing a value, which will allow you to understand and predict how the variable will work.

Mental models are very important in understanding, especially the internal workings of a system and having inaccurate mental models about something will cause bugs and confusion and that’s why you need to develop better mental models.
