# JavaScript mental models: Variables hoisting

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable declaration appears to have been moved to the top of their scope and this allows us to use them even before they have been initialised or assigned to a value, in this case, the value will be `undefined`

```js
var name; // variable declaration (memory is allocated for the variable)
name = "John doe"; // variable assignment (variable is provided with value)
```

You can combine both of them to be

```js
var name = "John doe"; // variable initialization (variable  is declared and assigned an initial value)
```

## var, let, const, and global variable hoisting

Global variables
When a variable is declared without any keyword it is treated as a global variable.

```js
name = "John Doe"; // global variable
```

This is because usually the engine when it meets a variable assignment without a keyword, will try to find its declaration in the current or scope above the current one, and when it canâ€™t find it will take it as a global variable

## var hoisting

var variables are hoisted on the top of their scope and accessing them before assignment the value will be undefined. Function-scoped variables can only be accessed in the function though even if they are declared with var

## let and const hoisting

Let variables be hoisted but accessing them will result in an error. The program will be aware of them but their value will not be accessed. Const variables cannot be hoisted since they always need to be initialised as their value will not be changed anyway
