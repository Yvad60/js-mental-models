# JavaScript mental models: data types

Datatypes is a concept used to describe a set of values and operations that can be made on different values.

For example, having “hello / 20” would not make sense because logically text can’t be divided by a number. That is why numbers are grouped differently than text and similar values will be grouped according to operations that can be applied on them.

JavaScript provides 8 data types where 7 are primitive and 1 is a reference type. Primitive data types don’t have any methods or properties applied to them while the reference types do as they are complex values.

## Primitive values

- Numbers
- Strings
- Undefined
- Null
- Bigint
- Booleans
- Symbols

## Reference values

Everything else remaining is an object and objects can include Arrays, objects, and functions
