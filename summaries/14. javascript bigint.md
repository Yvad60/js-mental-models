# JavaScript mental models: JavaScript BigInt

Bigint is a JavaScript primitive data type that is used to represent huge numbers that the regular number types can’t represent. BigInts can be created by appending ‘n’ at the end of the element or by calling the `BigInt()` function by passing a number or a numeric string

typeof 123n // bigint
typeof BigInt(123) // bigint

Almost every operation that is valid for numbers also works for bigInt but they can’t be mixed with other types they have to be explicitly converted to the same type.
