# JavaScript mental models: the null datatype

Null is one of JavaScript's primitive datatypes which refers to the intentional absence of the value. It is used to mention that the value doesn’t point to any object.

Null is a reserved keyword and can’t be used as a variable or function name, typeof null will return ‘object’ but null is not an object and doesn’t have any property attached to it. And trying to access values from null will result in an error
