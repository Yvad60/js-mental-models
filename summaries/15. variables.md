# JavaScript mental models: Variables and assignment operator

Variables are like containers for storing values; whenever mentioned, they will revert to the original values. In Javascript, you can declare a variable using the let, const, or var keywords or without using anything at all.

```js
let name = 'john doe';
```

The above line declares a variable with a name (also known as an identifier) name and assigns it to the string value ‘john doe’

The = sign in JavaScript is known as the assignment operator ( not equal to like in Algebra ) it is used to assign a value to a variable.

```js
let number = 2;
number = number + 6; //This means that the number variable is assigned to the value from (number + 6)
```
