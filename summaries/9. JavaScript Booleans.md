# JavaScript Booleans

In JavaScript booleans are data types; data represents one of the two values: true  and false. When something can only have one or another value like, yes or no, on or off booleans are good for such values.

In JavaScript booleans can be either primitive values or objects and they act differently according to the case

```js
const isRaining = true // primitive boolean
const isAuthorized = new Boolean(true) // object since it was created with the boolean constructor
```

Usually it is rare and not recommended to create your booleans using the boolean constructor

## The Boolean function

The Boolean() function is used to convert other values into primitive boolean values. Values with empty a value are converted to false and the rest to true. `0, NaN, "" , undefined, null` are considered as falsy value () and everything else will be true (converted to true)
